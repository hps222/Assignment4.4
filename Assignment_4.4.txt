1. Use the package RcmdrPlugin.IPSUR.data(RcmdrTestDrive)
and perform the below operations:

a. Calculate the average salary by gender and smoking status.

Solution:

data("RcmdrTestDrive")
attach(RcmdrTestDrive)
names(RcmdrTestDrive)
str(RcmdrTestDrive)

Method 1:
x <- tapply(salary, list(gender=gender,smoking=smoking),mean) 
x


Method 2:
by(salary,RcmdrTestDrive[,c(3,2)],mean,na.rm=TRUE)


b. Which gender has the highest mean salary?

Solution:
Highest mean salary is Male.

c. Report the highest mean salary.

Solution:
x[which(x==max(x))]


d. Compare the spreads for the genders by calculating the standard deviation of salary by gender.

Solution:
y <- tapply (salary, list(gender = gender), sd) 
by(salary, gender, sd, na.rm = TRUE)

boxplot(salary~gender, xlab="salary", ylab="gender", main="", notch=FALSE, varwidth=TRUE, horizontal=TRUE, data=RcmdrTestDrive)
